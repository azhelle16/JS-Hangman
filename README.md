# Word Guess

## Description

An application based on the Hangman Game.

### How Does It Work?

Like the Hangman game, the player's objective is to guess the word before the number to guess runs out.

The player can choose among seven categories: 

<b>_90's Movies, American TV Shows, Sports, Music Artists, Scientists, Fruits and Animals._</b>
