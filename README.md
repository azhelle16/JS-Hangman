User can select from seven categories. The categories of the game are 90's movies, american tv shows, sports, music artists, scientists, fruits and animals.

User can start guessing by pressing any keys. 

User has 15 guesses to guess the word.

If the user is able to guess the word, the user will hear a chime and the word guessed will also be displayed for few seconds to see what the name of the movie was. The number of wins and games played will be updated.

If the user used all 15 guesses before guessing the movie, the user will hear a buzzer and the correct word will also be displayed for few seconds so the user will see what the word was. The number of losses and games played will be updated.

If user pressed a key that is already guessed, the user will also hear a sound.  

If user clicks the reset button, the number of wins, losses and games played will be resetted to 0 and a new word will be picked to guess.
